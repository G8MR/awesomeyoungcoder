# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm G8MR, a teenage developer who likes cubing, maths (Yes, you read it right!) and is TOTALLY obsessed with Harry Potter (a bit obsessed with Star Wars as well, to be honest).
I work mainly on Python, but nevertheless I'm also working on web development - that is, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - as well as game development.
My hobbies are to write, read, cube, play around with Lego, listen to music, play chess, solve tough and mind-boggling riddles, as well as play the piano.
I'm currently working on CoreAI, a simple Python text-bot, as well as PyEncrypter, an open-source Python encryption/decryption library.
