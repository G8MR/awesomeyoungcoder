# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm G8MR, a teenage developer who likes cubing, maths, and (no surprises here) coding.
I work mainly on Python, but nevertheless I'm also working on web development - that is, HTML, CSS and JavaScript - as well as game development.
My hobbies are to write, read, cube, play around with Lego, listen to music, play chess, solve tough and mind-boggling riddles, as well as play the piano.
I'm currently working on PyEncrypter, an open-source Python encryption/decryption library.
